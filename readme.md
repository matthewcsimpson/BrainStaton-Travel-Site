Notes - 24 July 2022

- I attempted to make the design responsive.
- I added the "getting started page" linking from the button and also the nav bar. The form currently has no action.
- The nav bar items all have a highlight underline now when :hover-ed.
- Issue - The underlining on the nav bar sits lower than in the mockup.
- Issue - The spacing of the elemends in the footer is a little off compared to the mockup.
